# QualityBuilder
please use the official version when it gets updated. All I did was update for 1.6 and fix the ideology furniture bug and unforbid on reload bug. If you notice bugs please let me know as I do want to fix those while the official isn't updated yet.

github to report bugs, or report bugs in here. I'd prefer in github though. https://github.com/pkp24/QualityBuilder

With QualityBuilder you are able to set a minimum quality you want on an object you want to build.
Tired of placing, deconstructing, and replacing 100's of beds just to get some decent ones? This ends now! You can set the minimum quality you want to get from your selected objects.

If the finished object does not meet your minimum quality requirements, it will get deconstructed and replaced in the same position
